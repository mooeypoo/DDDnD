A humorous simulation game about software architecture decision making using concepts from Domain-Driven Design.

Players act as a systems architect trying to improve a struggling software system, balancing architecture quality, developer morale, stakeholder satisfaction, delivery confidence, user trust, and budget — every decision involves tradeoffs.

## Project Status

🚧 **Pre-release** — Core engine, content system, simulation runner, and UI are functional. Gameplay balancing is in progress.

### What's Implemented

- Deterministic simulation engine with full turn resolution pipeline
- 4 playable scenarios with differentiated card/event pools
- 29 architecture cards with usage limits, cooldowns, and delayed effects
- 7 stakeholders with 20 reaction rules (including escalation triggers)
- 12 events including conditional triggers
- 13 delayed effects (architectural aftershocks)
- System coupling rules (collapse mechanics that penalize neglected dimensions)
- Outcome classification (tiers and legacy archetype criteria, presented as ending types in UI)
- Automated simulation runner with telemetry and strategy-fingerprint analysis
- Save/load/export system
- Storybook component library
- Shareable end-of-run results

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
|---|---|
| `monolith_of_mild_despair` | A legacy monolith suffering from unclear domain boundaries |
| `microservice_sprawl` | Too many services, not enough coordination |
| `compliance_gauntlet` | Regulatory pressure meets technical debt |
| `startup_hypergrowth` | Move fast, break things, then fix them under pressure |

## Architecture Principles

### Domain Separation

The codebase is organized into clear domains:

- **content** — Authored game data and validation
- **simulation** — Deterministic game engine (UI-agnostic)
- **persistence** — Save/load/export functionality
- **reporting** — Summaries and shareable results
- **ui** — Vue components and presentation

### Simulation Purity

The simulation domain is **pure and deterministic**:

- ✅ Depends only on scenario bundles and game state
- ✅ Uses seeded random for reproducibility
- ❌ No Vue imports
- ❌ No Pinia imports
- ❌ No browser APIs
- ❌ No localStorage

### UI Boundaries

UI components may:
- ✅ Call simulation engine services
- ✅ Display results
- ❌ Implement gameplay rules
- ❌ Modify simulation behavior

All gameplay logic belongs in `src/domains/simulation`.

## TypeScript Philosophy

TypeScript is used to improve clarity and safety:

- **Strong typing** in simulation, content, persistence, reporting, and shared contracts
- **Light typing** in UI layer
- **Readable** code over clever type gymnastics
- **Explicit** named exports

Avoid advanced type-level programming and unnecessary abstraction.

## Content Philosophy

Content files are:

- **Human readable** — Non-programmers should understand them
- **Versioned** — Use `<id>-v<version>.json` format
- **Explicit** — Use snake_case keys, avoid cryptic identifiers
- **Deterministic** — Same content = same behavior

See [CONTENT_SCHEMA.md](./CONTENT_SCHEMA.md) and [CONTENT_VERSIONING.md](./CONTENT_VERSIONING.md) for details.

## Testing

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests once (no watch)
npm test -- --run

# Run tests with browser UI
npm run test:ui
```

Critical areas covered by tests:

- Deterministic turn resolution
- Scenario bundle construction and validation
- Stakeholder rule evaluation
- Delayed effect scheduling and resolution
- Card cooldown and usage limit enforcement
- System coupling rules
- Export/import round-trip
- Run determinism (same seed + actions = same result)
- Strategy-fingerprint telemetry correctness
- Content expansion packs (Pass A and Pass B)

### Simulation Runner

The project includes a CLI simulation runner for automated gameplay telemetry. It runs many games with random card selection using a seeded PRNG, and produces aggregate statistics useful for balance tuning.

```bash
# List available scenarios
npm run simulate -- --list

# Run 50 simulations (default) with formatted output
npm run simulate -- --scenario monolith_of_mild_despair

# Custom run count and seed
npm run simulate -- --scenario startup_hypergrowth --runs 300 --seed my-seed

# JSON output (aggregate only)
npm run simulate -- --scenario compliance_gauntlet --runs 100 --seed abc --json

# JSON output with per-run detail
npm run simulate -- --scenario microservice_sprawl --runs 10 --seed xyz --json --per-run

# Run all scenarios and save reports
for s in monolith_of_mild_despair microservice_sprawl compliance_gauntlet startup_hypergrowth; do
  npm run simulate -- --scenario "$s" --runs 300 --seed balance-pass > "./temp/sim-${s}.md"
done
```

The telemetry report includes:

- **Outcomes** — Win rate, outcome tier distribution, legacy archetype criteria distribution (can be presented as ending types in UI)
- **Scores** — Average final values for each score
- **Stakeholders** — Average final satisfaction per stakeholder
- **Card usage** — How often each card was played across all runs
- **Event frequency** — How often each event triggered
- **Reaction frequency** — How often each stakeholder reaction fired
- **Opening card frequency** — How often each card appears in the first 3 plays
- **Opening sequence frequency** — Most common exact opening card sequences
- **Average score by turn** — Per-score average trajectory across all runs
- **Winning card pairs** — Most common card co-occurrences in successful runs
- **Successful low-score rates** — Fraction of wins with critically low scores (identifies non-binding constraints)

Simulations are deterministic: the same seed produces identical results.
